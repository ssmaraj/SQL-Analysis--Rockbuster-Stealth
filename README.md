Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis

📖 Project Overview

Rockbuster Stealth LLC was a movie rental company that is transitioning to an online video streaming service.
As part of this strategic shift, the data analytics team was tasked with analyzing existing rental data to answer key business questions about revenue, customer behavior, and global reach.

This project is part of my CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program and demonstrates the use of SQL for querying, analyzing, and presenting business insights.
