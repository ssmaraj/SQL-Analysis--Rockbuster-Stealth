Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis

Project Overview

Rockbuster Stealth LLC was a movie rental company that is transitioning to an online video streaming service.
As part of this strategic shift, the data analytics team was tasked with analyzing existing rental data to answer key business questions about revenue, customer behavior, and global reach.

This project is part of my CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program and demonstrates the use of SQL for querying, analyzing, and presenting business insights.


Key Business Questions
	•	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue?
	•	What was the average rental duration for all videos?
	•	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
	•	Do sales figures vary by region?
	•	Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?


 Tools & Technologies
	•	SQL (PostgreSQL) – queries and data analysis
	•	Excel – query storage and supporting analysis
	•	PowerPoint – presentation of findings and recommendations
	•	PDF (Data Dictionary) – documentation of tables, relationships, and definitions


Key Insights
	•	Revenue Concentration: The top 10 countries generate 52% of Rockbuster’s total revenue, despite operations in 108 countries.
	•	Customer Behavior: Average rental duration is 5 days at an average price of $2.98.
	•	Movie Performance: Top 10 movies contribute only 3.8% of revenue — mid-tier films offer major growth opportunities.
	•	Genre Trends: Sports, Animation, Action, Family, and Sci-Fi are the top-performing categories globally.
	•	Ratings: PG-13 films generated the highest revenue, showing strong audience demand.
